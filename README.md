# searchIt
Provides a one click script to search google using your default browser with the contents of your clipboard as a search query. 

This will also work as a command line function using the prefix:

`$ searchIt <your search query>`

Try binding this script to a mouse/keyboard button!

You will also need [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed as a prerequisite.
